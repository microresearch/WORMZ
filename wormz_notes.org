* first notes

multiple xy movements of worms 

different modes for worms eg. collisions, interactions

number of worms and worm assignments

frozen movements and sequencing???

worm world boundaries

worm wavetables built in (so sample rate questions)

* hardware notes

STM32F4 or F103 (depends on ADCs in - 16 channels on F103)

8x DAC - what is DAC on O+C: https://ornament-and-cri.me/schematic/ 

DAC8565=4 channels so x2 for our 4 worms x and y out

* notebook notes

eg. 4 worms x,y with cvs for speed but also position at trigger to jump to (so they can jump to and then worm).

mode for each worm?

4x

cv ins: x, y, mode=knob_only, speed+knob, pulse/trigger in

16x ADC total, plus 4x trigger in (transistor based)

on trigger: dependent on mode=

1-snap worm to these co-ords then worm
2-set goal for worm
3-place obstacle here

cv outs: x, y (8x DAC)

* see older worm code and notes
