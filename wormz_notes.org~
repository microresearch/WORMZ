* first notes

STM32F4

multiple xy movements of worms 

different modes for worms eg. collisions, interactions

number of worms and worm assignments

frozen movements and sequencing???

worm world boundaries

worm wavetables built in (so sample rate questions)

* notebook notes somewhere???

eg. 4 worms x,y with cvs for speed but also position at trigger to jump to (so they can jump to and then worm).

mode for each worm?

* see older worm code and notes
